## Description

This app will allow tourists, especially those visiting multiple locations, to navigate their journey easily by keeping all information regarding current weather and attractions in one place. At the start of their visit, they can type in every destination planned to see the main attractions and current weather in that area. We specify that tourists visiting multiple locations benefit the most as it will allow them to keep track of their plans and potentially postpone or change certain destinations in the wake of unforeseen weather.
